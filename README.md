# D Package Search

An indexer and search API for D programming language packages as registered on https://code.dlang.org, using Apache Lucene.

## Setup

To set up and run the program, all you need is Java version 21 or higher, and then run the project using your favorite IDE. It will boot up a web server that you can use to search for packages at http://localhost:8080/search?query=test, replacing `query=test` with what you want to search for.
